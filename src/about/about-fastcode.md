## An open-source community

Fastcode is an open-source community dedicated to advancing software performance engineering (SPE) -- making software run fast or otherwise consume few resources such as time, storage, and energy.

## Focusing on research and education

Fastcode has an "academic-first" strategy to kick-start the SPE community. Then, by capturing the hearts and minds of students learning about parallel computing and SPE, the core community can grow to help the larger world of software developers cope with the end of Mooreâ€™s Law.

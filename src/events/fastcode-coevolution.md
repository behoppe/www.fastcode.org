The central idea behind Fastcode is that performance and efficient use
of resources must remain a core focus of computing. Achieving these
goals requires advances not only in algorithm design, but also in
programming models, software construction, compilers, and hardware.
Progress in one of these areas often influences and reshapes the others.

For example, a new code pattern may first appear as a hand-crafted
optimization by an expert programmer, then evolve into a portable
compiler transformation, and eventually inspire changes in hardware
architecture or system design. Such cross-pollination drives innovation,
yet opportunities for the communities to engage in joint discussion
remain limited.

The Fastcode workshop aims to bring together researchers and
practitioners to explore this co-evolution of algorithms, compilers, and
hardware. We will focus on sharing insights across domains, identifying
open problems, and fostering collaborations that advance performance
engineering as a discipline.

The workshop will be organized as a half-day event (approximately four
hours). It will feature a mix of invited and contributed talks,
complemented by a panel discussion. Talks will highlight recent advances
as well as challenges that could shape the next generation of research.
Importantly, the workshop emphasizes idea exchange rather than
publication, so it does not require proceedings.

PPoPP provides the ideal venue for this workshop. Parallel
programming---the heart of PPoPP---is a driving force behind modern
compiler and hardware research. Moreover, the co-location with CGO and
HPCA naturally connects all three dimensions of the ecosystem that
Fastcode seeks to address. We believe the workshop will be of strong
interest not only to the PPoPP community but also to participants of the
co-located conferences.

# Proposed Activities

-   **Invited talks:** We will invite distinguished speakers recognized
    for high-impact contributions in algorithms, compilers, and
    hardware.

-   **Contributed talks:** We will solicit proposals from the broader
    community. Submissions will include an abstract and up to two pages
    of description. Each submission will undergo peer review, and
    accepted talks will be presented at the workshop.

-   **Panel discussion:** To conclude the workshop, we will hold a panel
    session where speakers and participants can discuss open challenges,
    research directions, and opportunities for collaboration.

# Organizing Team

-   J Nelson Amaral (University of Alberta),
    [jamaral@ualberta.ca](jamaral@ualberta.ca){.uri}
-   Bruce Hoppe (MIT), [behoppe@mit.edu](behoppe@mit.edu){.uri}

# Proposed Program Committee (Pending)

We propose the following list of program committee members. We expect
the review workload to be relatively low, which is around 3--5 talk
abstracts per PC member.

-   Peng Wu (Meta)
-   Charles Leiserson (MIT)
-   John Regehr (University of Utah)
-   Maryam Mehri Dehnavi (University of Toronto)
-   Angelina Lee (Washington University in St. Louis)
-   Fredrik Kjolstad (Standord University)

(Bruce and Nelson, if you want to include anyone in addition, please
feel free to directly change the list.)

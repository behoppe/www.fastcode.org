## Introduction

We are happy to announce the first **Fastcode Challenge** at [PPoPP 2025](https://ppopp25.sigplan.org/). Fastcode Challenge is a student programming competition, and a subsequent workshop at PPoPP to invite participants with outstanding submissions to submit papers and give invited talks. There will also be invited talks from keynote speakers. 

The goal of the competition is to engage more students in learning parallel algorithms and programming, offering them resources and support to enhance their skills, and cultivating students' interests in writing fast code. We hope these efforts will inspire more students to study parallel programming and parallel computing research, thereby making a positive impact on their future careers. We encourage students from all levels to participate, including K-12 students, undergraduate students, Master's students, and Ph.D. students. 

Our topic of the first Fastcode Challenge focuses on a classic graph processing problem: single-source shortest paths (SSSP). SSSP is a fundamental graph problem covered in most (if not all) undergraduate (sequential) algorithm classes, such that all CS students are familiar with it. However, it becomes much more challenging in parallel computing research. In fact, there are tens of papers published every year focusing on improving their performance or related problems in top conferences. Therefore, there are various open directions to explore for performance engineering. 

## Highlights

- **Multiple awards** \[a link to awards\] are available, some with prize money. All student participants can apply for a dedicated travel grant to cover travel expenses and registration fees.    
- All participants can submit their methodology as a short paper, which will be peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be **published as workshop papers along with PPoPP proceedings**.   
- Award-winning submissions and authors of accepted papers will be invited to **present their work** at the workshop (Day 0 at PPoPP). 

## Organizers and sponsors

The Fastcode Challenge is mainly organized and sponsored by the Fastcode Community (initiated by the OpenCilk team), which is an open-source community dedicated to advancing software performance engineering. The OpenCilk team provides support through the speedcode.org platform with an interactive interface for participants to debug and test their code. The Fastcode community is supported by NSF funding.

We are also honored to be sponsored by xxxx (maybe Citadel).

## Important dates

- Nov. 10, 2024: Registration and competition starts  
- Jan. 10, 2025: Competition ends  
- Jan. 20, 2025: paper submission due  
- Feb. 3, 2025: final notification  
- Mar. 1, 2025: Workshop

## Awards and prizes

- 1 First Prize  
- 1-2 Second Prizes  
- 1-3 Third Prizes  
- Best Paper  
- Best Presentation  
- Best Undergraduate Submission  
- Best Pre-college submission (if applicable)  
- Based on the performance of the submissions, special awards may be available (e.g., best performance on social networks). 

## Workshop papers and talks

The papers will be peer-reviewed separately from the code submissions. The performance of the code will be considered, but a lot more criteria about paper writing will be considered, including clarity, formalization, simplicity/elegance/generality of methodology, etc. 

All first, second and third prize winners will be invited to submit papers and give talks, which will always be included. For other submissions, even though the performance may not be at the top among all participants, the papers may be accepted if they are solid papers on their own, some examples include but are not limited to

- The paper provide a interesting technique that improves performance on a certain type of graphs;   
- The paper present nice framework/general methodology for this problem  
- The paper include detailed and in-depth experimental study

## Competition rules
(Maybe Brian can put in more details)

- (We should allow a team with at most x people to participant, so they can join as a team)  
- To be considered as an award winner, the participant(s) are required to open-source their code.   
- …

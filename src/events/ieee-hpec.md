## Abstract

Task-parallel programming (TPP) technology is increasingly adopted by the computing community to accelerate complex scientific problems. TPP offers more efficient handling of irregular patterns (e.g., graph algorithms, recursion) compared to traditional loop-parallel models. This session brings together authors and contributors of several popular TPP libraries, such as OpenCilk, HPX, and Taskflow, to present their technologies, share insights from their design decisions, and demonstrate real-world applications. The session will outline a concise set of guiding principles and diagnostic questions to help attendees evaluate trade-offs among different TPP tools in the context of software performance engineering. By the end of the session, attendees will gain a comparative foundation for selecting the most suitable TPP tool for their parallel workloads.



## Featured speakers

(10-15 minutes per speaker)

* [TW Huang, Chief Architect of Taskflow](./taskflow/)
* [Hartmut Kaiser, Chief Architect of HPX](./hpx/)
* [TBD1, OpenCilk](#)
* [TBD2?, Nanos/OmpSs?](#)


{% alert "success" %}
See this [taxonomy](/about/task-parallel-tech/) for a concise table comparing features of notable TPP platforms.

## Lightning Talks?

Depending on how many featured speakers we have, or how much Q&A we expect, we might also seek 3-5 minute “lightning talks” from programmers (students?) who talk about how they’ve used any of the featured platforms.

## Abstract

Amazon delivers tens of millions of shipments worldwide on a daily basis. Planning the last-mile routes that reach final customers requires solving massive combinatorial optimization problems at scale. This talk discusses the many challenges associated with planning these routes, including the crucial role played by performance optimization.

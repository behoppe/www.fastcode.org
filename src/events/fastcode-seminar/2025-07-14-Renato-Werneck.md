## Abstract

Amazon delivers tens of millions of shipments worldwide on a daily basis. Planning the last-mile routes that reach final customers requires solving massive combinatorial optimization problems at scale. This talk discusses the many challenges associated with planning these routes, including the crucial role played by performance optimization.

## Bio

Renato Werneck is a Senior Principal Scientist at the Modeling and Optimization team at Amazon, working on algorithms to optimize Last Mile deliveries. Before joining Amazon in 2014, he was at Microsoft Research Silicon Valley for eight years. His research interests include Algorithm Engineering, Data Structures, and Combinatorial Optimization, with focus on the design, analysis, implementation, and experimental evaluation of practical algorithms. He holds a doctoral degree in Computer Science from Princeton University, a master’s degree in Informatics from PUC-Rio, and a bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from Unicamp.

HOPC will be held in conjunction with the [ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA’25)](https://spaa.acm.org/)

## About

With recent advances in hardware, parallelism is becoming increasingly ubiquitous, and work on parallelism now regularly appears at dozens of conferences and communities. Motivated by the now ubiquitous nature of parallelism, we believe it is an opportune time to host a workshop focused on the Highlights of Parallel Computing (HOPC) at SPAA.

## Important Dates
- Submission deadline:	5/28/25
- Poster presentation:	7/28/25 (SPAA reception)

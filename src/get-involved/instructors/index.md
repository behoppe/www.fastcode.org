# Welcome

{% img "/img/cel-learn-spe.png", "550px" %}

Whether you're curious about teaching your first-ever performance-engineering module or wanting to share the success of an existing SPE class, you are welcome to join Fastcode's SPE instructors community.

# Helpful resources

### For starters

Here is a short paper, "[Helping faculty teach software performance engineering](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2fj7x89s)," published at [EduPar-24](https://tcpp.cs.gsu.edu/curriculum/?q=edupar24). EduPar (an annual workshop at IDDPS) and its sibling EduHPC (at SC) are organized through [CDER](https://tcpp.cs.gsu.edu/curriculum/?q=node/21183), which develops and curates many useful resources for teaching parallel and distributed computing. See also [Get started with SPE](/get-involved/get-started-spe).

To help you develop your own course or module on SPE, below is an incomplete list of relevant classes and workshops. Each listing includes links to lecture PDFs and sometimes videos.

Do you have your own class or module to add to our list? Please [let us know](/get-involved/contact/).

### For community members

When you join the Fastcode instructors community, you get access to editable slide decks and LaTeX documents, and you are welcome to join SPE-instructor discussions to share ideas and questions with like-minded faculty.

# List of classes and workshops

## UC Berkeley

#### [CS267](https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/cs267-spr2024): Applications of Parallel Computers

CS267 was originally designed to teach students how to program parallel computers to efficiently solve challenging problems in science and engineering, where very fast computers are required either to perform complex simulations or to analyze enormous datasets.... While this general outline remains, a large change in the computing world started in the mid 2000's: not only are the fastest computers parallel, but nearly all computers are becoming parallel.... Students in CS267 will get an overview of the parallel architecture space, gain experience using some of the most popular parallel programming tools, and be exposed to a number of open research questions.

## Cornell

#### [CS 5220](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5220/2024fa/schedule.html): Applications of Parallel Computers

CS 5220 is an introduction to performance tuning and parallelization, particularly for scientific codes. Topics include:
* Single-processor architecture, caches, and serial performance tuning
* Basics of parallel machine organization
* Distributed memory programming with MPI
* Shared memory programming with OpenMP
* Parallel patterns: data partitioning, synchronization, and load balancing
* Examples of parallel numerical algorithms
* Applications from science and engineering

## CMU

#### [15-418/15-618](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15418/schedule.html): Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming

 From smart phones, to multi-core CPUs and GPUs, to the world's largest supercomputers, parallel processing is ubiquitous in modern computing. The goal of this course is to provide a deep understanding of the fundamental principles and engineering trade-offs involved in designing modern parallel computing systems as well as to teach parallel programming techniques necessary to effectively utilize these machines. Because writing good parallel programs requires an understanding of key machine performance characteristics, this course will cover hardware design and how that affects software design.

This course will provide a comprehensive introduction to parallel algorithms and parallel programming, with strong emphasis on the design of parallel algorithms and their rigorous analysis. Exposure to parallel programming is provided through programming assignments using MPI. Throughout the course, the design of algorithms is interlaced with the programming techniques useful in coding them.

Topics include cache-friendly algorithm analysis and implementation, parallel programming, concurrent data structures, tools for effective performance engineering, and modern high-performance computing (HPC) applications.

## Johns Hopkins
#### [EN 601.420/620](http://parallel.cs.jhu.edu/schedule2024.html) Parallel Computing for Data Science
This course studies parallelism in data science, drawing examples from data analytics, statistical programming, and machine learning. It focuses mostly on the Python programming ecosystem, but we will use C/C++ to accelerate Python and Java to explore shared-memory threading. It explores parallelism at all levels, including instruction level parallelism (pipelining and vectorization), shared-memory multicore, and distributed computing. Concepts from computer architecture and operating systems will be developed in support of parallelism, including Mooreâ€™s law, the memory hierarchy, caching, processes/threads, and concurrency control. The course will cover modern data-parallel programming frameworks, including Dask, Spark, Hadoop!, and Ray. The course will not cover GPU deep-learning frameworks nor CUDA. The course is suitable for second-year undergraduate CS majors and graduate students from other science and engineering disciplines that have prior programming experience.

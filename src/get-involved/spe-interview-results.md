The Fastcode team interviewed 60 individuals across academia, industry, and government about software performance engineering. We asked them, “Why is SPE important and where is it headed?” This document summarizes what we heard.

## Practicing SPE

Doing SPE includes many different activities. For example:

* Identifying and analyzing performance bottlenecks  
* Selecting appropriate algorithms and data structures  
* Optimizing code for specific hardware platforms  
* Utilizing parallel programming techniques  
* Monitoring and measuring performance  
* Collaborating with different stakeholders to achieve optimal performance outcomes.

## Importance and Relevance of SPE

The demise of Moore's Law signals the end of the traditional reliance on hardware improvements for performance gains. SPE is increasingly vital for making the most of existing hardware resources. The results matter for a variety of reasons, including:

* Innovations when performance improvements unlock the potential to solve problems that were previously intractable  
* Competitive advantage for businesses providing a time-critical software platform (e.g. an operating system, web browser, or financial trading system)  
* Cost savings and environmental benefits thanks to consuming fewer resources, such as CPU time, memory, and energy  
* Scalability when software is engineered to handle increased load  
* Improved responsiveness for a person using the program.

## Future Directions and Goals

We heard about important SPE work happening in areas such as compilers, domain-specific languages, parallel programming, performance modeling and analysis, and hardware/software co-design.

Many interviewees expressed a desire to see SPE principles and practices applied more widely across computer science, related fields, and industry. For example:

* Many real-life SPE projects involve detective work in the face of incomplete information about a large program that is tightly constrained by both resources and compatibility with legacy systems. We need better ways to incorporate these elements into CS education.  
* We need a way to recognize and reward software contributions in fields beyond mathematical software, perhaps through peer review of software artifacts alongside research papers.  
* We need SPE researchers to “listen more to people who actually use" the tools and techniques they develop, by engaging more with domain scientists and application developers.

Communication gaps are a key challenge for SPE. The gaps sometimes mirror the heterogeneity of the systems we are studying. They are fueled by reward systems that prioritize discovering new things over composing existing things. They are also exacerbated by the rapidly evolving technical landscape.

The future of SPE will be shaped by emerging trends and challenges, including the emergence of new hardware architectures, the increasing importance of energy efficiency, and the rise of AI. For example:

* There are tremendous opportunities to improve our ability to use heterogeneous hardware architectures and to do in-memory computation.  
* Some large technology companies are now measuring performance in terms of megawatts saved. How might this approach be adopted elsewhere?  
* The energy consumption of AI presents big opportunities for applying SPE, but at the same time, the dominance of AI casts a shadow that might diminish the priority given to SPE.

The interviews underscore the growing importance of SPE in a world increasingly reliant on software and constrained by limited resources. The insights shared by these individuals point towards a future where SPE plays a more central role in computer science education, research, and practice.

## Help wanted

Would you like to publish a short article that helps a broad audience to get curious about something you're into?

The Fastcode blog is currently collecting stories and will start publishing in winter 24/25.

Tell us your story (or story idea) and let the Fastcode blog promote your work and interests in SPE. 

## Making SPE more accessible

What do you think is interesting right now about SPE? 

Why does it matter? 

Stories we'd love to hear about include
* why you decided to create a class on SPE
* what you learned from teaching SPE (or doing some other SPE project)
* why SPE matters at your university or corporation
* the opportunity (or danger) that AI presents to SPE
* how you see the interface between HPC (or field `x`) and SPE
* why you use language `x` or tool `y` for SPE
